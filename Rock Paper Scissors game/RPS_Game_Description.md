Rock Paper Scissors Game
Welcome to the ultimate Rock Paper Scissors game! 🎮✊✋✌️

This game will allow you to test your luck and strategy in a friendly battle with your computer. Will you choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors? The choice is yours, but beware—your fate is in the hands of the almighty computer!

How to Play 🕹️
Choose one of the three options:

Rock (🪨)

Paper (📄)

Scissors (✂️)

The computer will randomly choose its option.

The game will announce:

If Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors 🤜✂️)

If Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper ✂️📄)

If Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock 📄🪨)

If you both choose the same thing, it's a draw! Draws are for wimps... just kidding, it’s all part of the fun! 😉
Enjoy the Game!
You can play as many times as you want. But remember, the computer will always win. Or will it? Try to prove me wrong! 😏
